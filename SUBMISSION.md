## Database Schema
The comprehensive database schema required to deploy LeadFlow CRM, including all table formations, foreign keys, enums, pipeline stage seed data, and Row Level Security (RLS) policies, has been meticulously documented and provided in the root directory file `database-schema.sql`.

## Email Delivery (Resend)
Please note that since I do not currently have a custom domain, I am using my personal email (`anupamsingh584210@gmail.com`) as the verified sender address through Resend to send emails(During Lead Generation). This configuration can be easily updated in the future to use a professional domain once one is available.
